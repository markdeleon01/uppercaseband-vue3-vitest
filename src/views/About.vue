    // By default, Pinia will add the "Store" suffix to the id of each store. You can customize this behavior by calling the setMapStoreSuffix().

    // this.user_store, this.cart_store

    // Note that store is an object wrapped with reactive, meaning there is no need to write .value after getters but, like props in setup, we cannot destructure it.
